<b>Background</b><br/>
Provide a problem statement / summary of business issue to be addressed. E.g. In July 2022, Vision One performed focus group interviews with Sovereign customers, resulting in the identification of 3 areas of support, with 5 segments as follows:<br/>
High Support - Very vulnerable or Stressed and Stretched<br/>
Medium Support - Stable striving or Stable static<br/>
Low Support - Inherently independent<br/><br/>

<b>Objective</b><br/>
State what the business goal is of this project. E.g. Sovereign are working with Vision One to define customer segments and personas, with a view to assisting customer facing teams to shape their services based on customer need.<br/><br/>

<b>Benefit</b><br/>
Provide a list of the business benefits this project will provide. NOTE: these will be used to measure the success of the project. E.g. Initially the results will help identify customers applicable for assistance via the Customer Support Fund.<br/><br/>

<b>In scope</b><br/>
Provide an overview of the work the project will include. E.g. As a first pass at using internal data to help identify customers in these groups, we're focussing on Income data, to include the following:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Current balance data and arrears history (12-18 months), reviewing method of payment - direct vs indirect payers</li>
<li>Benefit claimants, identified as claiming UC (check HB numbers)</li>
<li>Vulnerability flags to identify higher support needs, in any household member, identifying if these are with children</li>
<li>Data from CRM to identify those already in receipt of tenancy /income support</li>
<li>Fuel voucher provision (not centrally held today)</li>
<li>Initial customer data from CoRE - Howard to confirm areas of interest</li>
</ul>
It's suggested high support customers are likely to be on an annual income of £20K or less and mainly claiming benefits.
